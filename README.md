# TableOfPoints
Java project that allows to build graphs of some functions by points and see these points

This project is based on laboratory works that's why you can find some unnecessary things in it, for example, LinkedListTabulatedFunction class. I was forbidden to use java.util package so you can find binary search and so on instead of methods from java.util.
